    <h2> Roboto Mono</h2>
    <p> The blueish light of the sun felt warm on my face. The van was nearing its destination, a large blooming field of sunflowers. The old building beyond the golden field was where I spent the last 3 years of my life in confused turmoil. </p>

    <h2 class='Mincho'> Shippori Mincho</h2>
    <p class='Mincho'> Perhaps my interest in you is just my lust disguised as something less sinister. I’m infatuated with your voice. As sweet as honey. Not too high. Not ear scraping. I’m infatuated with your smile. Not twisted like mine. Yours is an organic smile. On nights of insanity, when I have my weekly mental breakdown, I secretly imagine how your embrace would feel.</p>
